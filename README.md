##Make Change Project
- This is the final version of my individual project assigned for end of week one of SD7.
- The program calculates correct amount of change returned to a customer based on the purchase price and the amount tendered, and notifies the user of how many of each piece of currency ($20 ,$10 ,$5 ,$1, .25c, .10c, .05c, .01c) is needed to make the change for the customer. 
- The change is made using the largest bill and coin denominations as possible. Denominations that are not used are not displayed.
